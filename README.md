# ReDAL extension by motion flow

This extension creates semanticaly pure regions for dynamic objects and link them through time, therefore it is possible to propagate annotations of these objects to entire sequence.

## Data Preparation

This repo supports SemanticKITTI and Waymo Open Dataset datasets.

At first please create data preparation, which is provided in original implementation of the ReDAL method [this documentation](ReDAL-extension-by-motion-flow/ReDAL-extension/w_pseudolabeling/data_preparation).
